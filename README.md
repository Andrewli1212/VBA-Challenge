# VBA-Challenge

This Challenge consist of a multiple year stock data for the year of 2018, 2019, and 2020, 3 screenshots of the VBA program running correctly for each year, and a VBA script of the code itself. The VBA script allows the user to calculate the yearly change, percent change, total stock volume, greatest percent (increase, decrease, and volume). By using the for loops, conditions, and formatting, the script was able to run correctly.

I had Kelli Kennedy, a tutor of the bootcamp, to assist me in creating the script. She help me start of the script by teaching me how to write the input, output, and update variables.

I also used the websites, outside of the bootcamp, to help me on my journey. Listed below are the websites I used.
